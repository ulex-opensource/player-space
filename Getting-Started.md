Make a note of the link to your space.
1. If you are familiar with pull requests, fork [Lexinomicon](https://github.com/ulex-opensource/Lexinomicon) to your own account and add your own player-space to the [Player roster](https://github.com/ulex-opensource/Lexinomicon/Roles/Player), otherwise ask a current player to do so on your behalf.

Once the PR is merged, you're in!
